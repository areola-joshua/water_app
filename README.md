   :blush:`About:` 

   :smile: Welcome to the `Water Potability Prediction App`. This Streamlit web 
   application enables users to `predict water potability` based on various 
   water :clap: quality parameters. :open_mouth: Through interactive `visualization` tools 
   and a `user-friendly interface`, users can explore water quality data, input 
   parameter values, and obtain predictions regarding `water potability`.:stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: 
   The app also provides `evaluation metrics` to assess the performance of the `machine 
   learning model`, making it a valuable tool for researchers and environmentalists
   interested in `water quality assessment` :wave:
